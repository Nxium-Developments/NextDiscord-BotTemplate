#### â€¢ **Dynamic Command Handler:**

- My template comes in with a dynamic command handler! Using the command handler, you don't need to indulge in main bot files to create your very own command!
- You can simply make command groups (categorized as folders) in the [commands](https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template/tree/master/commands/) folder.
- Your JavaScript commands goes inside respective category folders. A sample command is provided as [ping](https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template/blob/master/commands/misc/ping.js) command. You can use the same skeleton for all commands you want!

#### â€¢ **Dynamic Event Handler:**

- All events goes inside the [events](https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template/blob/master/events/) folder. You don't need to use `client.on()` in the main `bot.js` file to handle events.
- Using simple skeleton code for events, you can make any amount of events in the events folder using the event handler.

#### â€¢ **Dynamic Trigger Handler:**

- Triggers occur when a specific "phrase" is said in a message content. For example, if you want your bot to react with :heart: when someone say `welcome` in their message, you can do that with this trigger handler!
- Trigger Handler also has the same skeleton structure as of command handler. The trigger handler is associated with the [triggers](https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template/tree/master/triggers/) folder. There are trigger categories, like [reactions](https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template/tree/master/triggers/reactions) folder, in the trigger folder.
- A sample trigger command is given in the [`hello.js`](https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template/tree/master/triggers/reactions/hello.js) trigger file.

#### â€¢ **Dynamic Slash Command Handler:**

- My template comes with a dynamic slash command handler with very easy to customize and make slash commands.
- The commands, in the slashCommands folder, receive an [`CommandInteraction`](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/CommandInteraction) object. You can see the [documentation of discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/CommandInteraction) for all the properties and methods available.
- **IMPORTANT:** In the template, we are sending the slash commands to discord to be registered only to 1 guild. That is because their are 2 types of slash commands, guild and global. Guild commands are restricted to 1 guild but whenever you update them, they take effect immediately, whereas global commands take upto 1 hour to take effect. So use guild commands in development and global commands for production.

#### â€¢ **Dynamic Buttons Interaction Handler:**

- This template comes with a dynamic button interaction handler to receive and process button interactions.
- Buttons can be classified in two category folders.

#### â€¢ **Dynamic Modals Interaction Handler:**

#### â€¢ **Dynamic Context Menu Handler:**
