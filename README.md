> An **open source** `discord.js` bot template which is based on official [discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/) to get started on making your very personal discord bot!

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template#readme)

## Introduction

`NextDiscord` Bot Template is an open-source Discord bot template built on discord.js. It serves as a starting point for new bot projects, forked from [NamVr/DiscordBot-Template](https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template). This template is written in classic JavaScript and does not rely on any external dependencies, distinguishing it from other popular frameworks. It's not a framework itself but rather a foundational structure for building bots. With this template, you can easily scale your bot projects, whether they're single-server based or multi-server based, depending solely on your creativity!

`NextDiscord` will get updated frequently with the latest discord features added, this fork is made due to the lack of updates to the [original](https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template) template, which has some outdated
features. Inwhich we will be updating it frequently with newer features.

> 🛠️ **NEW!** _This template now supports **in-built typing (typescript-assistance) support** too, which means you will get all typescript-like assistant in vanilla javascipt! (Visual Studio Code tested, working 100% as expected)_

### Features:

This template comes with [NamVr's official bot template](https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template) features, but with other newer additions added such as;

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Configuration

- Rename [`config-example.json`](https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template/blob/master/config-example.json) to `config.json` and fill the token and other values. Extend config.json according to your needs!

## Run your bot

```sh
npm start
```

## Support & Documentation

I'm working to make it more professional and easy to use for everyone. There will be a documentation out very soon.
